Step 2 : Build static version in React - part 1
Exercise 2 of 7


# Introduction

Now that you have your component hierarchy it's time to start implementing your
app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and
renders the UI but has no interactivity. It's easiest to decouple these
processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no
thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of
typing. We'll see why.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model you'll want
to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props
are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the
concept of state, don't use state at all to build this static version. State is
reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since
this is a static version of the app you don't need it.

You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building
the components higher up in the hierarchy
(i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it
(ProductRow). In simpler examples it's usually easier to go top-down and on
larger projects it's easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

# Exercise

Let's build top-down. Build the top level component; FilterableProductTable.

Simply refer to the React docs if you need help executing this step;
http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html

# HINT(s)

You are going to need react (and the test utils) for this exercise. Install it
using npm.

   $ npm install react@15.1.0 react-dom@15.1.0
   $ npm install react-addons-test-utils@15.1.0

As of React v15 we also need to install some react test utils in order to make
things work.

We are using ES2015 syntax in these exercises. Here is what a really basic React
component looks like.

   import React from 'react'

   export const FilterableProductTable = React.createClass({
       render() {
           return (
               <div></div>
           )
       }
   })

You might notice we are using HTML in our javascript here. Whaaa? It's called
JSX, and it's a central part of React. It let's you keep your markup together
with your code.

Remember to export your components, so that I can verify your solution.

# GENERAL HINT(s)

Run your solution:

   $ thinking-in-react run solution.js

When you are done, verify:

   $ thinking-in-react verify solution.js

To view in browser:

   $ thinking-in-react server solution.js

and it'll be available (hopefully) on http://localhost:3333
